High-Level Design (HLD) Document: Multi-Region Deployment with Load Balancing :-
1. Solution Diagram :-

2. Target Architecture Description :-
The application must be highly available and fault-tolerant through multi-region deployment by employing load balancers and database replication.

(1) Multi-Region Deployment:-

The application shall be deployed across two different regions for redundancy, say, Region 1 and Region 2.
Each region will have its respective load balancer, LB1 and LB2, respectively, to distribute the traffic within the region.

(2) Global Load Balancer (GLB):-

A global load balancer will route traffic based on latency and availability to the nearest or healthiest region.

(3) Web Server Redundancy :-

WebServerVM is replicated across both regions, serving static content.
In the event of regional failure, there will be automatic routing to another region.

(4) Database Replication and Failover :-

SQLVM configuration with primary in Region 1 and secondary replica in Region 2.
Data consistency across the regions is maintained by database replication.
It is behind the configuration of automatic failover to switch over to the secondary database in case of primary region downtime.

(5) Redundancy and Failover Mechanisms :-

Load Balancers: These ensure traffic distribution and avoid single-point failures.
Database Replication: Ensures data availability and consistency.
Automatic Failover: This minimizes the chances of downtown by automatically switching over to the secondary region during outages. 

3. Migration Steps :-

The migration will be performed in the following key stages:

Step 1: Replication of Virtual Machines Across Regions

Creating a cloud-based VM replication service - AWS Application Migration Service or Azure Site Recovery.
Enabling real-time replication for WebServerVM and SQLVM to the secondary region.
Testing failover by simulating a regional outage.

Step 2: Configuration of Load Balancers

Deploying a Global Load Balancer - AWS Route 53, Azure Traffic Manager - with routing policies :-
	Primary Region Routing: US-East as primary, US-West as failover. 
	Health Checks for the availability of web servers. 
Using Local Load Balancers in each region to distribute traffic across multiple web servers. 

Step 3: Database Replication and Failover Implementation Configure SQL Database Replication: AWS RDS Multi-AZ, Azure SQL Geo-Replication. 

Creating an automatic failover mechanism for the SQLVM. 
Testing failovers to make sure of seamless switching between primary and secondary databases.
